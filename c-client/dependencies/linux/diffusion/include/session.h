/**
 * @file session.h
 *
 * Functions relating to a session and session management.
 *
 * A client session to a server or cluster of servers.
 *
 * A new session can be created by connecting to a server using
 * `session_create_with_session_factory`, specifying the server URL. There is also
 * a non-blocking variant `session_create_async_with_session_factory`. The session
 * factory can be configured to control the behavior the session.
 *
 * The session provides a variety of operations to the application. These are
 * grouped into feature headers, such as `topics.h` and `messaging.h`.
 *
 * <h3>Session lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * Each session is managed by a server. The server assigns the session a
 * unique identity, and manages the session's topic
 * subscriptions, security details, and session properties.
 *
 * A session can be terminated using `session_close()`. A session may also be
 * terminated by the server because of an error or a time out, or by other
 * privileged sessions using the ClientControl feature.
 *
 * A client can become disconnected from the server, and reconnect to the server
 * without loss of the session. Reconnection can be configured using
 * `diffusion_session_factory_reconnection_strategy` via the session factory.
 * The server must be configured to allow reconnection.
 *
 * If a session is connected to a server that belongs to a cluster with session
 * replication enabled, and then becomes disconnected, it will attempt to
 * reconnect to the original server. A properly configured load balancer can
 * detect that the original server is unavailable and re-route the reconnection
 * request to a second server in the cluster. The second server can recover
 * session data and continue the session. This process is known as "fail over".
 * Unlike reconnection, in-flight messages can be lost during failover, and the
 * application will be unsubscribed and re-subscribed to topics.
 *
 * The current state of the session can be retrieved with `session_state_get()`.
 * A listener can be registered when the session is created, which will be
 * notified when the session state changes.
 *
 * <h3>Session properties</h3>
 *
 * For each session, the server stores a set of session properties that describe
 * various attributes of the session.
 *
 * There are two types of session property. Fixed properties are assigned by the
 * server. User-defined properties are assigned by the application.
 *
 * Many operations use session filter expressions that use session properties
 * to select sessions.
 *
 * A privileged client can monitor other sessions, including changes to their
 * session properties, using a session properties listener. When registering to
 * receive session properties, special key values of
 * `PROPERTIES_SELECTOR_ALL_FIXED_PROPERTIES` and `PROPERTIES_SELECTOR_ALL_USER_PROPERTIES`
 * can be used.
 *
 * Each property is identified by a key. Most properties have a single string
 * value. The exception is the `$Roles` fixed property which has a set of string
 * values.
 *
 * Fixed properties are identified by keys with a `$` prefix. The available
 * fixed session properties are:
 * <table>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td><b>Key</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description</b></td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr valign="top">
 *    <td>`$ClientIP`</td>
 *    <td>The Internet address of the client in string format.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr valign="top">
 *    <td>`$ClientType`</td>
 *    <td>The client type of the session. One of `ANDROID`, `C`,

 *        will be a zero length string.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr valign="top">
 *    <td>`$GatewayType`</td>
 *    <td>Gateway client type. Only set for gateway client sessions.

 *  </tr>
 *  <tr valign="top">
 *    <td>`$GatewayId`</td>
 *    <td>The identity of a gateway client session. Only present if the $GatewayType

 *  </tr>
 *  <tr valign="top">
 *    <td>`$Longitude`</td>
 *    <td>The client's longitude, if available. This will be the string

 *  <tr valign="top">
 *    <td>`$MQTTClientId`</td>

 *    <td>The session transport type. One of `WEBSOCKET`,
 *        `HTTP_LONG_POLL`, `TCP`, or `OTHER`.</td>

 * </table>
 *
 * All user-defined property keys are non-empty strings. The characters <code>' '</code>,
 * <code>'\\t'</code>, <code>'\\r'</code>, <code>'\\n'</code>, <code>'"'</code>, <code>'''</code>,
 * <code>'('</code>, <code>')'</code> are not allowed.
 *
 * Session properties are initially associated with a session as follows:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>When a client starts a new session, it can optionally propose
 *      user-defined session properties (see `diffusion_session_factory_property`
 *      and `diffusion_session_factory_properties`). Session properties proposed in this
 *      way must be accepted by the authenticator. This safeguard prevents abuse by a
 *      rogue, unprivileged client.
 *  <li>The server allocates all fixed property values.
 *  <li>The new session is authenticated by registered authenticators. An
 *      authenticator that accepts a session can veto or change the user-defined
 *      session properties and add new user-defined session properties. The
 *      authenticator can also change certain fixed properties.
 * </ol>
 *
 * Once a session is established, its user-defined session properties can be
 * modified by clients with `GLOBAL_PERMISSION_VIEW_SESSION` and `GLOBAL_PERMISSION_MODIFY_SESSION`
 * permissions using `diffusion_set_session_properties()`.
 * A privileged client can also modify its own session properties.
 *
 * If a session re-authenticates (see `change_principal()`), the
 * authenticator that allows the re-authentication can modify the user-defined
 * session properties and a subset of the fixed properties as mentioned above.
 *
 * <h3>Session filters</h3>
 *
 * Session filters are query expressions for session properties. They can be
 * used to address a set of sessions based on their session properties. For
 * example, it is possible to send a message to all sessions that satisfy a
 * specified filter. Session filters are parsed and evaluated at the server.
 *
 * A session filter expression consists of either a single clause, or multiple
 * clauses connected by the binary operators `and` and `or`. The
 * `and` operator takes precedence over `or` but parentheses can be
 * used to override the precedence. For example:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>`Department is "Accounts"`
 *  <li>`hasRoles ["operator" "trading desk"]`
 *  <li>`Department is "Payroll" and Status is "Closed"`
 *  <li>`(Department is "Accounts" or Department is "Payroll") and Status is "Closed`
 * </ul>
 *
 * The unary `not` operator can be used to negate the following clause or
 * an expression within parentheses:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>`Department is "Payroll"`
 *  <li>`not (Department is "Payroll" or Department is "Accounts"`
 * </ul>
 *
 * An equality clause has the form <em>key operator value</em> where
 * <em>key</em> is the name of a session property and <em>value</em> is the
 * property value. The supported operators are `is` or `eq`, both of
 * which mean "equals", and `ne` which means "does not equal". Values are
 * strings enclosed within single or double quotes. Special characters
 * (<code>"</code>, <code>'</code> or <code>\\</code>) can be included within the value by
 * preceding with the escape character <code>\\</code>. The utility method `diffusion_escape()`
 * can be used to insert escape characters into a value.
 *
 * The `all` operator matches all sessions.
 *
 * The `has` operator can be used to check if a property is present. This is useful
 * for determining whether a user-defined property or an optional fixed property is set for a session.
 *
 * `hasRoles` is a special operator for querying the `$Roles`
 * session property. A `hasRoles` clause has the form <em>hasRoles
 * ["role1" "role2" ... "roleN"]</em>. The clause will match sessions that have
 * all the specified authorisation roles. Each role is a string enclosed within
 * either single or double quotes. Roles can be space or comma separated.
 *
 * The `in` operator allows for the querying of a specific session property
 * to see if it exists in a defined set. An example of this would to be filter all
 * sessions from a set of countries, say Germany, France, and the UK. The query would be
 * `$Country in 'UK','DE','FR'`.
 *
 * The lists provided to `in` and `hasRoles` can optionally use square brackets and commas as delimiters.
 * For example `$Country in ['UK','DE','FR']`.
 *
 * The `$Roles` session property can also be queried with an equality
 * clause, for example, <code>$Roles eq '"admin","client"'</code>, but the
 * `hasRoles` clause is usually more convenient. An equality clause will
 * match sessions that have exactly the listed roles. In contrast, a
 * `hasRoles` clause will match any sessions with the listed roles,
 * regardless of whether they have other roles. The equality clause requires the
 * value to be in the canonical form produced by the `diffusion_roles_to_string()`
 * utility method.
 *
 * All operators are case insensitive.
 * <h4>Examples</h4>
 *
 * The following are further examples of valid session filter expressions:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><code>$Principal is "Alice"</code>
 *  <li><code>Department is "Accounts" and $Country ne "US"</code>
 *  <li><code>$Language EQ "en" and $Country NE "US"</code>
 *  <li><code>not (Department is "Accounts" or Department is "Payroll") and $Country is
 *      "FR"</code>
 *  <li><code>Text is "xyz\"\\\\\"</code>
 *  <li><code>hasRoles ["operator"]</code>
 *  <li><code>$Transport is "wss" and hasRoles ["accountancy" "administrator"]</code>
 *  <li><code>hasRoles ["operator"] and not hasRoles ["administrator"]</code>
 *  <li><code>$Version in {"6","7","8"}</code>
 *  <li><code>$Country in ['UK','DE','FR']</code>
 *  <li><code>has Department</code>
 *  <li><code>all</code>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Session locks</h3>
 *
 * The actions of multiple sessions can be coordinated using session locks. See
 * file `session-lock.h`.
