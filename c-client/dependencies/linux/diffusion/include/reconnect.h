 *        the pointer when no longer needed.
 *
 * A retry_count of 0 means that no reconnection attempts will be
 * made.
 *
 * A retry_delay greater than 0 and a retry_delay of 0 will retry for a set
 * amount of time (\ref DIFFUSION_DEFAULT_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT) before giving up.
 *
 * Otherwise, retries will continue for (retry_count * retry_delay) seconds unless
 * explicitly overridden with reconnection_strategy_set_timeout().
 *
 * @param retry_count   The number of attempts to make.
 * @param retry_delay   The time between connection attempts, in milliseconds,
 *                      or 0 to request the system default timeout.
 *
 * @retval "RECONNECTION_STRATEGY_T *"  A pointer to a new reconnection
 *                                      strategy that can be passed to a
